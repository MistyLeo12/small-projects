# Folder of small coding projects to help out with some daily task or for fun

## Drinks.py
Program returns a drink object with the kinds of drinks that can be made with certain liquor. This small project was for Fun and to help me practice more with OOD and parsing JSON with Python. Future: Adding more drinks into JSON file and allowing users to query by ingredients and not just the main liquor.

## Partner Selector (team-assigner.py)
Program I made to randomly partner people together each week to come up with a spotify playlist together for an on campus publication that I was the Audio/Video Editor for. Potential: Adding a 3rd party api that would notify each person would have been a next step which would have been useful--also sending reminder notifications to that weeks member.
